White people make up 72% of the American population while African-Americans make up only around 12. 3%. In 2019 alone 1, 089 people were killed as a result of police brutality. Likewise, African American's made up 24% of that 1, 089. In other words, African American's make up less than 1/5 of our population but nearly a quarter of our police brutality deaths. In my opinion, Police brutality in any aspect, Towards any group of people is unacceptable, However because of the data it is clear to see that African American's are far more likely to be injured of killed as a result of police brutality than white people. In addition, While opposing the Black Lives Matter movement, People will also say \"Well black people kill more black people\" and while that is true it is also a fact that white people kill more white people, It's simple demographics. People are more likely to kill those in their general area. Saying Black Lives Matter does not mean that all other lives matter. Of course white lives matter but the difference is that white people have never in history been oppressed, Segregated, Enslaved, Or discriminated against because of the color of their skin. If your child died and you were giving a speech and you said \"My child was incredibly special\" wouldn't it be rude and appalling for someone to say \"All children matter! \". . .

Instead you'd put water on the house that's on fire. It doesn't mean all of the other houses don't matter, It just means we are focusing on the one who is in extreme danger. For the Christians out there, Jesus would leave his 99 other sheep to go save the one that was in danger.
